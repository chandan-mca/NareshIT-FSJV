=====================================================

01. What is Java?
    - Java ia platform independent
      Object-Oriented programming langauge	

02. Why Java?
    - Java is invented for achieving platorm independency
      for developing internet based business applications

    - The main purpose of Java is developing 
      internet applications (or) web applications (or) websites 	

    - Note: by using Java we can develop both 
      Stand-alone applications and also internet applications
	    - if we use only Core Java, then application is SA
	    - if we use Core Java + Adv Java, then the application is IA

03. Who invented Java?
     - Java is invented by Mr. James Gosling 
       in SUN Microsystems in the year June 1991
       for developing highy secured network based 
       business applications.
    	
04. Types of applications?
     - All softwares or projects are broadly 
       divided into 2 types
	1. Stand-alone applications
	2. Internet applications

     - An application that is installed in one computer
       and can not be accessed from other computers via
       internet is called stand-alone applications.

       	Ex: Calc, MS-Office, Anti Virus, Game softwares, 
	    VLC, browser, mobile apps, etc...




	- A SA is a single user and single computer application

	
     - An application that is installed in one computer
       and can be accessed from other computers via
       internet is called internet application.

     - For example: amazon.in, facebook.com, instagram.com,
                    gmail.com, youtube.com, nareshit.com,
		    hkprogrammingworld.in, etc...



     - A IA is a multi user and multi computer application
       it means at a time multiple people from different mulitple 
       computers can  access this internet application

       - For example: At this point of second many users
         can access 'amazon' project through our the world 

05. What is platform, platform dependent, platform independent?
     Platform
     ========
       - A platform is an environment in which 
         a program is loaded, executed and produced output

       - A platform can be a software only platform or 
         hardware only platform or both

	  - For storing a program we need memory
	  - For running a program we need a software

      => A computer platform is both SW and HW platform
         that is [OS + Processor + Hard Disk + Ram]


      => C and C++ programs platform is software only platform
         it is OS. It is means C and C++ programs are 
	 executed directly by OS 

      => Java programs platform is JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
         It is means Java program is not executed 
	 directly by OS, instead it is exeecuted by 
	 one intermediate software called JVM.

      => Python programs platform is PVM(Python Virtual Machine)
      => .Net programs platform is CLR(Common Language Runtime)
      => HTML pages platform is Browser

      => Audio and Video files platform is Media Player (VLC)
      => Image files platform is image reader 'google Photos' or 'paint'

 Platform dependency
 ===================
     - A program that is developed in one OS (say windows),
       if it can not be executed in different OS (say Linux and Mac),
       then that program is called Platform dependent program.

     - The programming language that is used to develop this program
       is called platform dependent programming language.

     - For example: C and C++ PLs and their programs are PD
       


 Platform Independency
 ===================
     - A program that is developed in one OS (say windows),
       if it can be executed in different OS (say Linux and Mac),
       then that program is called Platform independent program.

     - The programming language that is used to develop this program
       is called platform independent programming language.

     - For example: Java, Python PLs and their programs are PI






	Note:
	  - If a program is directly executed by an OS,
	     then this program is PD

	  - If a program is not directly executed by an OS,
	    if it is executed by an intermediate software like JVM
	    then this program is PI

06. Why C and C++ PLs are platform dependent?
