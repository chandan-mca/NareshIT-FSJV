Day #2: Core Java details
=========================
1. What is Core Java?
	- Core Java is the First course in 'Java or FSJD'
	- It is the main course in FSJD
2. What will we learn as part of core java?
	- Core Java is used for developing one complete project.
	- Whatever the knowledge required to development a project, 
	  we will learn those complete concepts in Core Java
	- As part of Core Java we will learn
		1. Java language concepts 
		2. Math based programs development
		3. Object-Oriented programming
		4. Project Development (SA)
	- The project developed by using CJ will be a Stand-alone project
          it can not be accessed from other couputers via internet 
	  like amazon project 
	
	- For making project accessible from internet, 
	  in addition to CJ we must also use Adv Java + Oracle + HTML
	  	SA	     ->	only Core Java
		IA	     ->	HTML,JS + Adv Java    + Core Java + Oracle 
		Fast	     ->	HTML,RJ + Spring boot + Core Java + Oracle
		Developement 
	- Latest project in companay developed Spring Boot based 
		UI		-> HTML, CSS, BS, JS, RJ
		Progamming	-> Spring Boot, Core Java, Microservices
		Data Base	-> Oracle (SQL, PL/SQL)
