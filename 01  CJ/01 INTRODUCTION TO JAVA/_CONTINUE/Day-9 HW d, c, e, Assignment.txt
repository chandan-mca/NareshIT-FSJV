=====================================================

01. What is Java?
    - Java ia platform independent
      Object-Oriented programming langauge	

02. Why Java?
    - Java is invented for achieving platorm independency
      for developing internet based business applications

    - The main purpose of Java is developing 
      internet applications (or) web applications (or) websites 	

    - Note: by using Java we can develop both 
      Stand-alone applications and also internet applications
	    - if we use only Core Java, then application is SA
	    - if we use Core Java + Adv Java, then the application is IA

03. Who invented Java?
     - Java is invented by Mr. James Gosling 
       in SUN Microsystems in the year June 1991
       for developing highy secured network based 
       business applications.
    	
04. Types of applications?
     - All softwares or projects are broadly 
       divided into 2 types
	1. Stand-alone applications
	2. Internet applications

     - An application that is installed in one computer
       and can not be accessed from other computers via
       internet is called stand-alone applications.

       	Ex: Calc, MS-Office, Anti Virus, Game softwares, 
	    VLC, browser, mobile apps, etc...




	- A SA is a single user and single computer application

	
     - An application that is installed in one computer
       and can be accessed from other computers via
       internet is called internet application.

     - For example: amazon.in, facebook.com, instagram.com,
                    gmail.com, youtube.com, nareshit.com,
		    hkprogrammingworld.in, etc...



     - A IA is a multi user and multi computer application
       it means at a time multiple people from different mulitple 
       computers can  access this internet application

       - For example: At this point of second many users
         can access 'amazon' project through our the world 

05. What is platform, platform dependent, platform independent?
     Platform
     ========
       - A platform is an environment in which 
         a program is loaded, executed and produced output

       - A platform can be a software only platform or 
         hardware only platform or both

	  - For storing a program we need memory
	  - For running a program we need a software

      => A computer platform is both SW and HW platform
         that is [OS + Processor + Hard Disk + Ram]


      => C and C++ programs platform is software only platform
         it is OS. It is means C and C++ programs are 
	 executed directly by OS 

      => Java programs platform is JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
         It is means Java program is not executed 
	 directly by OS, instead it is exeecuted by 
	 one intermediate software called JVM.

      => Python programs platform is PVM(Python Virtual Machine)
      => .Net programs platform is CLR(Common Language Runtime)
      => HTML pages platform is Browser

      => Audio and Video files platform is Media Player (VLC)
      => Image files platform is image reader 'google Photos' or 'paint'

 Platform dependency
 ===================
     - A program that is developed in one OS (say windows),
       if it can not be executed in different OS (say Linux and Mac),
       then that program is called Platform dependent program.

     - The programming language that is used to develop this program
       is called platform dependent programming language.

     - For example: C and C++ PLs and their programs are PD
       


 Platform Independency
 ===================
     - A program that is developed in one OS (say windows),
       if it can be executed in different OS (say Linux and Mac),
       then that program is called Platform independent program.

     - The programming language that is used to develop this program
       is called platform independent programming language.

     - For example: Java, Python PLs and their programs are PI






	Note:
	  - If a program is directly executed by an OS,
	     then this program is PD

	  - If a program is not directly executed by an OS,
	    if it is executed by an intermediate software like JVM
	    then this program is PI

06. Why C and C++ PLs are platform dependent?
	- The C and C++ programs are compiled targetting to one particular OS

	- hence C and C++ programs are compiled code contains ML 
	  of a particular OS whose format is not understandable to differnt OS

	- Below diagram shows Java's PI

07. How Java achieved PI?
	- In Java, program is not compiled targetting to any particular OS
	- Java program is comipled into one intermediate language code, bytecode
	- Then later this byte code is translated to a particular OS's ML code
	  and run by using JVM
	- We have separate JVM for every OS, hence the same compiled code, byte code
	  is executed in all OS with the help of JVM
	- Hence Java achieved PI, that is WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere).
	
	- Below diagram shows Java's PI
	
8. Important facts on Java program and Java software?
	Refer diagrams

9. Types of Java software?
	Refer diagrams

10. Differences between JDK, JRE?
	Refer diagrams

11. Why JRE is removed in Java 11v?
	Refer diagrams

12. Installing JDK software?
	1. Open Browser
	2. Type 'Download Latest JDK', press enter
	3. Click 'Java Downloads'
	4. Click Windows tab 
	5. Click 'jdk.exe' file link
	6. After downloading is completed
	7. Click on JDK.exe file -> click yes -> Click Next
	8. Click 'Change' -> remove 'Program Files\Java\'
	   make path as 'C:\jdk-22\' -> Click Ok
	9. Click 'Next' -> installation is completed -> click 'Close'
	10. JDK software is installed in 'C:\jdk-22'
	    This folder is called JAVA_HOME

    - Test whether JDK running or not?
    	- open command prompt [press start -> type cmd -> press enter]

	- Type the command 'javac  -version' press enter
	   it must display javac 22.0.2

	- Type the command 'java  -version' press enter
	   it must display java version "22.0.2" 2024-07-16
	
    - JDK software is installed and running successfully
    - Now we can develop programs

13. Softwares required to develop, compile and execute a Java program?
	- We need three softwares
		1. Editor		-> for developing a java program
					   for typing and saving a program
					   
		2. JDK			-> for obtaining Compiler and JVM into our system
					   and for compiling and running our program
					   
		3. Command prompt	-> for running 'Compiler and JVM' softwares 
		                           for compiling and running our Java program


	- Different Editor sofwares
		1. Basic editor		-> Notepad
		2. Advanced editors	-> Notepad++, Textpad, Editplus, Brackets, ...
		3. More Adv Editors[IDE]-> Eclipse, IntelliJ, STS, VS Code, .........

	
	- In our system we have Notepad, JDK and cmd prompt
	- Let's start programming

14. Java Programming Elements
	Java supports 8 programming elements
	==============================================================================
	Progrmming Elements		purpose
	==============================================================================
 	  1. Module		-> for grouping packages
	  2. Package		-> for grouping classes
	  3. Class		-> for representing RWO in PW
	  			   and for grouping variables and methods
	  4. Variables		-> for representing values and allocating memory 
	  5. Methods		-> for representing operations
	  6. Constructors	-> for storing values on variables
	  7. Blocks		-> also for storing values in variables
	  8. Inner classes	-> for representing inner object of an outer object	
	=================================================================================

15. Essential statements to develop, compile, execute and print some message on console?
	- We have 3 essential statements	
		1. class			-> for developing and compiling
		2. main method			-> for executing
		3. System.out.println(-);	-> for printing a value or message
	
	- The class is essential because Java is an OOP langauge,
	  hence every program must starts with a class
	
	- The main method is essential because main method is the 
	  initial point of execution of a class. JVM executes a class
	  starts with main method.
	  	Note: if class does not have main method,  
		      JVM throws error: 'main method not found'

	- The System.out.println(-); is essential because 
	  in Java we can print any value or message only by using
	  System.out.println(-);

16. Java program structure
	- class contains main method, 
	  main method contains S.o.println()  statement

	class  <classname>  {

		main method {
			System.out.println("message");	
		}
	}

17. Steps to develop a Java program?		
    - Java program develop, compilation and execition
      comes under 7 steps
	1. Open notepad
	2. Type Java code
	3. Save this progarm with .java extension

	4. Open command prompt
	5. Change drive and directory path 
	   to the project directory in which 
	   java program is saved
	
	6. Compile java program by usign 'javac' tool
	7. Execute byte code by using 'java' tool	 

18. Program #1: Develop a program to print HKProgrammingWorld on console

	Step #1: Open notepad [press Start -> type notepad -> press Enter]

	Step #2. Type below code

		class FirstProgram {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println("HKProgrammingWorld!");
		    }
		}
			
	3. Save this progarm with the name Example.java 
	   in the folder "D:\FSJD\01CJ\01JB"

	4. Open command prompt [press start -> type cmd -> press enter]

	5. Change drive and directory path 
		1. Type "D:" and press enter 
		2. Type "cd D:\FSJD\01CJ\01JB" and pres enter
		
	6. Compile java program by using 'javac' tool
		-> type "javac  Example.java"
			  |->FirstProgram.class
			  
	7. Execute byte code by using 'java' tool	 
		-> type "java  FirstProgram"
			   |->Output: HKProgrammingWrold	
	
19. Compilation and Execution procedure		
	- We compile by using compiler sofware 'javac'
	- The command for compilation 
		javac filename.java
	- Compiler produces byte code and saved in 
	  .class file with classname as file name

	- for example:
		javac  Example.java
		  |->FirstProgram.class

	- We run a program by using JVM by using 'java'
	- JVM takes byte code from .class file
	- The command for execution
		java  classname
	- JVM runs main method available in this given class
	  displays output

	- For example:
		java  FirstProgram
		  |-> HKProgrammingWorld
