/**
 * 25. Develop a program to write an object either array object or class object to a file
 * 
 *    	Limitation of FOS -> it can write only one byte of data
 *    	Limitation of DOS -> it can write only one PDT value/String 
 *    	Solution 		  -> we must use ObjectOutputStream (OOS)
 *    
 * OOS
 * ===
 *  1. The ObjectOutputStream is an OutputStream type object
 *  2. It is used for saving one object data inside the file 
 *  3. It also can connect to a file via FOS object
 *  4. Then it has a constructor to take OutputStream type object as an argument
 *  		ObjectOutputStream(OutputStream out)
 *  
 *  5. We must create object of this class by passing FOS object as argument 
 *     to connect to a file for saving given object data inside the file
 *  		OOS oos = new OOS(new FOS("object.ser");
 *  
 *  6. Inside OOS class we have a method writeObject() to save object state in a file
 *  		public void writeObject(Object obj)
 *  
 *  7. oos.writeObject(obj) method performs serialization  
 *  
 * Serialization
 * ============= 
 *  8. The process of 'converting an object into stream of bytes' and 
 *     saving object state inside a file permanently is called serialization
 *    
 * 			====================================================================
 * 	             JVM, Java program                            file
 * 			====================================================================
 * 					Student Object						        object.ser
 *               	  sno 
 *               	  sname    ---> oos.wO(s1)----byte[]--------> byte[] 
 *                    course
 *                    fee
 * 			====================================================================
 *  
 *  9. The rule in serialization the serializing object's class must implement 
 *     java.io.Serializable interface
 *     
 * 10. If this is serializing object is not Serializable type, oos.writeObject() method 
 *     throws NotserializableException and terminates serialization, because 
 *     saving object data inside a file is not safe operation, because if anyone got 
 *     access to serialized file, he can read our object data & we loose security            
 *    
 * 11. The Serializable interface is a marker interface it is an empty interface 
 *    
 * 12. By implementing Serializable interface, we no need to override any method from 
 *      this interface and we no need to develop serialization logic. The serialization logic 
 *      is already available in oos.writeObject() method
 *   
 * 13. By implementing Serializable interface, we are jsut providing permission to 
 *      oos.writeObject() method to serialize out class object
 *      
 * 14. Then oos.writeObject() method converts its argument object state into stream of bytes 
 *      and saves this object's state in the file permanently
 *   
 * .ser file structure
 * ===================
 * 15. The file that contains an object's serialized data is called serialized file 
 *     this file extension is .ser
 *     
 * 16. The .ser file must contain object information to reconstruct this object 
 *     by ois.readObject() method in deserialization process
 *     
 * 17. Hence this file contains below 3 information     
 *		1. serialVersionUID if this .class using which the object is created and serialized 
 *      2. the current object's class name
 *      3. Each field name, data type and its value
 *     
 *
